/*****  Release Notes for the Xbee Plus Bootloader  *****/
Current Version:  11.05
Date Released:  12/21/2009

/*****  New Features ********************************************/
Over-the-Air application update support
Over-the-Air menu support
Add memory size to bootloader version string

/*****  Defects Corrected ***************************************/

Don't allow Xmodem buffer pointer to overflow in event of synch loss

Do not write packet data to xmodem buffer if size is other than 84, 49, or 1

Resize bootloader start to 0xEA00

Added number-of-retries maximum for when we miss packets in transfer state

/*****  Known Issues/Limitations ********************************/

The 32Kb version of bootloader uses flash address 0xEA00-0xFFFF
this is the currently supported flash size.

/*****  History  ************************************************/
//11.03 Changes...
//  Fixed lLength return value bug by fixing function prototype
//  Removed sending of NAKs if MAX_RETRIES exceeded
//  Preserve application if MAX_RETRIES exceeded and state is init
//11.04 Changes...
//  Added support for Bootloader menu OTA (no access to bypass mode)
//  Check for #CTS_XBEE low before attempting OTA features
//  Write 1st recieved xmodem packet to flash last
//  Fixed bug in xmodemReceive where BUFFER_SIZE chars read in
//    after SOH already loaded in buffer - change index from 0 to 1
//  Increased stack size to 320 bytes
//11.05 Changes
//  Changed bootloader version string to include memory size (32)
//  Don't allow Xmodem buffer pointer to overflow in event of synch loss
//  Do not write packet data to xmodem buffer if size is other than 84, 49, or 1
//  Resize bootloader start to 0xEA00
//  Added number-of-retries maximum for when we miss packets in transfer state
//12.02 Changes
//  Rewrote xmodem to take normal uart and API
//  Removed files uart,ApitoXmodem, byte, Frame.c, serial, xmodemTick
//  Added Api.c  -> makes reading and writing to UART2 appear transparent.
//  Modified CmdProcessor to work with the Api.c
//  Condensed strings to take less space.
//  Added timeout backoffs automatically with xmodem
//  Added initial timeout start on menu
//  Added Reset on menu (This exits the Bootloader and runs the App if valid)
//  Change menu to only kick back menu for LF,CR,SPACE, and ('B' if it is over the air).
//  Changed bootloader startup to always jump to APP unless a command to do otherwise.
//    if an app is bad and keeps watchdogging or invalid instructions, after 16 tries,
//    the bootloader will stop running the App.
//  After 10 minutes of accumulated idle time, the Bootloader will reset (This runs the App if valid)
//  Bootloader size reduced to consume 3.5k instead of 5.5k
//    this affects the Vector table redirection and AppStringPtr locations.
//023 Changes
//  version 0.12.03 condensed to 023.
//  version response is now "BL032-2B0-023_064"
//  very few changes are expected, so it was better to use these bytes in the BL string for other things.

*       Versions
*
*  BLFFF-HHH-XYZ_DDD
*  FFF = Flash size in k;  032 = 32k Flash
*  HHH = Hardware depenancy 2B0 = S2B used Freescale MC9S08QE = 0
*  X   = Change of size of bootloader/ customization/ functionality 
*        '0' to '9', 'A' to 'D' reserved for Digi. D is used for Debuggable code
*  Y  = Major Change  ('0' to '9', 'A' to 'Z')
*  Z  = Minor revision (Beta revisions are Even, Releases are Odd)
*  DDD = Prefered Update XMODEM Payload size. 
*        064 = 64 bytes per packet 
*        Double the payload size is expected to also be handled, but not guaranteed.
*/
// future enhancement changes are planned to send back with the ACK another char indicating the packet acknowledged
// The 2 byte response will sometimes be 1 byte to avoid the confusion of ACK-NAK, ACK-CAN,ACK-ACK, NAK-NAK etc.
